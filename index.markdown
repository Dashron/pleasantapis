todo: break down a short list of fundamental goals. Each goal has title and brief description. Each goal links to a dedicated page for that goal with details and examples.

- consistent
- break the rules instead of bend them (don't try to make your api fit, if it doesn't, use something else)
- minimal required knowledge
- optional incremental improvements.
- works with existing tooling (oas, json schema, etc.)
