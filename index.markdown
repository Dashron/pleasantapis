todo: break down a short list of fundamental goals. Each goal has title and brief description. Each goal links to a dedicated page for that goal with details and examples.

- consistent
- break the rules instead of bend them (don't try to make your api fit, if it doesn't, use something else). Solves most use cases not all. Starting with pleasant APIs gives you the foundation to expand, and removes one step in the design process.
- minimal required knowledge
- optional incremental improvements.
- works with existing tooling (oas, json schema, etc.)
